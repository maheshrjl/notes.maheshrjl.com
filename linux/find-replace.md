`grep '^.' filename` - Get all lines that start with a dot or period

`grep -rnw '/path/' -e 'pattern'`&#x20;

* `-r` or `-R` is recursive,
* `-n` is line number, and
* `-w` stands for match the whole word.
* `-l` (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
* `-e` is the pattern used during the search

Along with these, `--exclude`, `--include`, `--exclude-dir` flags could be used for efficient searching:

* This will only search through those files which have .c or .h extensions:

`grep --include=*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"`

* This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:

`grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"`

* For directories it's possible to exclude one or more directories using the `--exclude-dir` parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching \*.dst/

`grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"`

### <mark style="color:purple;">Find based on file content</mark>

`find . -type f -exec grep "forinstance" '{}' ; -print`&#x20;
