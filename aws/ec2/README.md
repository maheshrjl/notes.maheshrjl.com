### <mark style="color:yellow;">AMI</mark>

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance.

* One or more Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
* Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
* A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Instance Types</mark>

* M : General Purpose i.e. app server
* T :  Micro instances - Low cost, general purpose, web servers
* C, D, I : CPU/IOPS Optimised, good for memory intensive compute
* R, X : Memory Optimised
* G, P : GPU
* F: FGPA - Field programmable gate array, for hardware accleration of code&#x20;

### <mark style="color:orange;">Instance Options</mark>

#### On Demand Instance:

* Pay a fixed rate per hour. Good for apps where compute needs scaling up/down

#### Spot Instance:

* Can be extremely cheap
* Can be terminated by AWS any time
* Best for jobs that can be terminated at any time eg: batch processing
* Not charged for partial hour if terminated by AWS but, charged for full hour if user terminated

<summary>Spot Instances &#x26; Spot Fleet</summary>

#### EC2 Spot Instance Request:

* Can get a discount of 90% compared to on-demand
* Define a max spot price & get the instance while current spot price  < max

#### Spt Instance Request Methods

* [Spot Instance requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#using-spot-instances-request)
* [Spot Fleet requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#create-spot-fleet)
* [EC2 Fleet requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/manage-ec2-fleet.html#create-ec2-fleet)

</details>

#### Reserved instance:

* Fixed compute, resverved for a certain period of time. Cheaper than on-demand if used for predicatable long term. (1 or 3 years)

#### Dedicated Host:&#x20;

* Physical EC2 server are available only to customer. Used when regulatory requirements specify that you must not be using multi-tenant computing.

#### Dedicated instance:

* EC2 instances running on hardware dedicated to a single customer
* Hardware can be shared with other instances in the same account
* No control over instance placement

### <mark style="color:purple;">Security Group</mark>

* Control how traffic is allowed into or out of ec2 instances
* Security groups contain allow rules only
* Rules can be referenced by IP or by security group
* Can be attached to multiple instances
* Locked down to a single region/vpc
* All inbound traffic is blocked & outbound traffic is allowed by default
* They control:
  * Access to Ports
  * Authrozied IPv4 & IPv6 address ranges
  * Control of inbound network (from outside to the instance)
  * Control of outbound network (from the instance to outside)

If a page is continously loading (timeout) it is most likely a security group issue.

### EC2 Placement Groups

1. **Cluster Placement Groups**: A logical grouping of instances within a single AZ.
   * Recommended for low network latency, and/or high network throughput applications.
   * Only specific to a single AZ
   * Can span peered VPCs in the same Region
2. **Partition Placement Groups**: Logical partition of instance groups such that no two partitions within a placement group share the same underlying hardware.
   * Reduces the impact of correlated hardware failures for your application
   * Mainly used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks.
   * Can have partitions in multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.
   * Offer visibility into the partitions using which you can check which instance is in which partition. Topology-aware applications, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra use this information to make intelligent data replication decisions for increasing data availability and durability.
3. **Spread Placement Groups**: each instance within a spread placement group will be placed in a different rack.
   * Recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
   * Reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks which is not the case in spread placement group
   * Can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.

### Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

An _elastic network interface_ is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. ENI's are bound to specific AZ. It can include the following attributes:

* A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
* One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
* One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
* One public IPv4 address
* One or more IPv6 addresses
* One or more security groups
* A MAC address

ENI can be moved from one instance to another (Failover)

### EC2 Hibernate

* The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
* The instance boot is faster (The OS has not been stopped/restarted)
* The whole state of the RAM is dumped to the root EBS volume (The root EBS volume must be ecnrypted)
* Use case: In-order to keep a long running process running, save the RAM state, Services that take long time to initialize.
* Supported instance family: C,M,R also, the RAM size must be less than 150 GB
* Not supported for bare metal instance & Amazon linux 2 & Ubuntu & Windows
* Available only for on-demand & reserved instances
* Instance cannot be hibernated for more than 60 days

### EC2 Nitro

* Underlying platform for next-gen EC2 instances (New virtualization tech)
* Enhanced networking options, HPC & IPv6 support&#x20;
* High speed EBS volume (64K EBS IOPS) only 32K IOPS supported on non nitro&#x20;
* Better security
* Instance types:&#x20;
  * Virtualized (A1, C5, C6, D3, G4)
  * Bare Metal (a1.metal, c5, c6\[metal])

### EC2 Capacity Reservations&#x20;

Planning in advance for capacity

* Capcity reservations ensure you have capacity when its needed&#x20;
* There is planned end date for reservation and 1 or 3 year commitment is not required
* Capacity access is immediate i.e. billed as soon as it starts
* AZ, number of instances & intance type/os must be specified
* Can be combined with reserved instances for cost saving
